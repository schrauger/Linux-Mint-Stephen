# Linux-Mint-Stephen
I like the Linux Mint theme. However, the applications in the panel always felt backwards. The highlighted (current) application always looked unselected. Perhaps I got used to the Windows XP look, but I just can't seem to make myself follow the highlight scheme.

So I swapped the background gradient for ".window-list-item-box" and ".window-list-item-box". Now all the inactive windows have the white highlight, while the active window looks like a selected button in that it has the same color as the panel background.
